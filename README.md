## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Always choose a container's width before styling the elements within it to minimise the amount of back and forth fidgeting with css values. I started messing with the paragraph element to scale it down to fit the card when I could simply style the the card and all the other elements will fit to the space available.
